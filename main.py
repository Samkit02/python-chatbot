Drink up to 8-10 glasses of water every day:  Staying hydrated is the best way to increase immunity to fight Coronavirus because it flushes out all the toxins from the body. Immunity booster drink such as fresh fruit juices and coconut water, along with consuming enough water throughout the day helps in keeping the body hydrated. 4. Donâ€™t skip these home workout exercises:  Home workout are another way of flushing out toxins from the body through sweat. Make sure not to skip exercises while staying home during the pandemic. Depending upon oneâ€™s stamina and routine, some of the easy workout exercises that can be done at home may include rope-skipping, push-ups, jogging on the spot, front plank, and forward lunges. 5. Practice These 3 Steps: A] Practice meditation:  Meditation is a mindful exercise that relaxes the mind of all external chaos and distractions. A mere 10 minutes of meditation every day can make a big difference not only throughout the day but also in life as a whole. A calm mind helps in better focus,  better decisions, and builds a sound body. B] Avoid Smoking and Alcohol:  Smoking and other substance abuse weaken the respiratory system, while alcohol reduces immunity. This makes the body susceptible to catching the virus and being infected. C] Avoid Non-essential travelling:  Social distancing is key to fighting novel coronavirus, and hence avoiding non-essential travel will help in protecting oneself and others from the virus.',
